# COMP20280 Data Structures Reposotiry 
This repository contains all of my code for the practicals throughout the semester. It includes an implementation of the following data structures: SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, CircularlyLinkedList, ArrayQueue, CircularQueue, LinkedQueue, LinkedDeque, ArrayStack, LinkedStack, LinkedBinaryTree, HeapPrioritityQueue, UnsortedTableMap, ChainHashMap, TreeMap, AVLTreeMap and SplayTreeMap. I have also included a set of Junit tests to test each of these data structures. 

## Getting Started
To get a copy of this project on your local machine, open your IDE and choose to import a project from github. Then, use the URL
https://github.com/ucd2016comp20010/datastructures-iva-mechkarova to import the repository. For example, on eclipse 
go to File > Import > Git > Projects from git (with smart import) > Clone URL and enter the URL.

## Testing The Data Structures
Each of the data structures include a main method where the structure is instantiated and operations are performed on it. Expected and actual results are printed after each operation. Also, there is a Junit Test class for each of the data structures. These tests can also be run to ensure that the basic features of the structure have been implemented correctly. 

## Built With
